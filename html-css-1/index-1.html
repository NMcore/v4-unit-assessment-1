                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document css
                    written ina markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside :
                    HTML and JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This :
                    separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of :
                    presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a :
                    separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and °
                    content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering :
                    methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. $
                    CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the :
                    specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading
                    priority scheme is predictable.
                    <p>
                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is
                    registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In :
                    addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
